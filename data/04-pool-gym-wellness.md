# Pool, Gym, and Wellness Facilities

## Swimming Pool

The outdoor pool is open from 08:00 to 20:00 daily (April through October). The indoor pool is open year-round from 07:00 to 22:00. No lifeguard is on duty — guests swim at their own risk. Signage must be clearly visible at all pool entrances.

Pool rules: swimming attire is mandatory (no street clothes in the pool), guests must shower before entering the pool, no glass containers are permitted in the pool area (drinks are served in plastic or acrylic), children under 12 must be accompanied by an adult at all times, diving is not permitted in any pool, no running on the pool deck, pool towels are provided at the towel station — guests should not bring room towels to the pool.

Towel service: guests present their room key card at the towel station to receive pool towels. Used towels are deposited in the collection bins. There is no charge for pool towels, but a €20 replacement fee applies for towels not returned (charged to the room).

Sunbed policy: sunbeds are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Guests may not reserve sunbeds with towels. Sunbeds left unoccupied for more than 45 minutes may be made available for other guests. The pool attendant manages this diplomatically.

The pool bar operates from 10:00 to 19:00 and serves cocktails, soft drinks, light snacks, and a lunch menu. Pool bar charges are signed to the room.

## Fitness Center

The gym is open 24 hours with key card access. Equipment includes treadmills, elliptical trainers, stationary bikes, a full free weights section, cable machines, and a stretching area. Complimentary water and towels are available inside the gym.

Rules: proper athletic footwear is mandatory (no sandals or bare feet), guests must wipe down equipment after use (sanitizing spray and paper towels provided at each station), the maximum time on cardio machines is 30 minutes when others are waiting, personal trainers from outside the hotel are not permitted — guests may book sessions with the hotel's certified trainer.

Personal training sessions are available by appointment: €60 for a 60-minute session, €35 for a 30-minute session. Booking is made through the Spa reception or by calling extension 7.

The gym is unsupervised between 22:00 and 07:00. Guests using the gym during these hours do so at their own risk. Emergency call buttons are located at the entrance and in the stretching area. CCTV is in operation for security purposes (signage displayed).

## Spa

The spa operates from 09:00 to 21:00 daily. Treatments include massages, facials, body wraps, manicures, and pedicures. A full menu with pricing is available in-room, at the spa reception, and on the hotel app.

Reservations should be made at least 24 hours in advance, especially for weekend appointments. A 50% cancellation fee applies for cancellations made less than 6 hours before the appointment. No-shows are charged the full treatment cost.

Guests should arrive 15 minutes before their appointment to use the sauna, steam room, and relaxation lounge. The sauna and steam room are accessible to all hotel guests from 09:00 to 21:00, not only spa clients.

## Children's Facilities

The kids' club operates from 09:00 to 17:00 for children aged 4-12. It is supervised by trained staff and is complimentary for hotel guests. Activities include arts and crafts, outdoor games, movie screenings, and swimming lessons (seasonal). Parents must complete a registration form and provide emergency contact information. The kids' club does not operate as a babysitting service — parents must remain on the hotel premises.

Babysitting services can be arranged through the concierge with 24 hours notice. The rate is €15 per hour with a minimum booking of 3 hours. All babysitters are vetted and insured through our partner agency.
