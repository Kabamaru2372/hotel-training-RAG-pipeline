# Pet Policy

## Accepted Pets

The hotel welcomes dogs and cats weighing up to 15 kg. A maximum of one pet per room is permitted. Pets must be declared at the time of booking or before arrival. A pet supplement of €25 per night is charged to the room.

Exotic animals, birds, reptiles, and farm animals are not permitted. Service animals (guide dogs, hearing dogs, mobility assistance dogs) are welcome at no additional charge regardless of size, as required by law. Documentation for service animals may be requested — accepted documents include a training certification or official identification card for the animal.

## Pet-Friendly Rooms

Pets are only allowed in designated pet-friendly rooms. These rooms have hard flooring (no carpet), are located on the ground floor with direct garden access, and are equipped with a pet bed, water bowl, and food bowl. Guests cannot bring pets into non-pet-friendly rooms, even temporarily.

Pet-friendly room inventory is limited. Early booking is recommended, especially during peak season. If no pet-friendly rooms are available, the reservation team should suggest alternative dates or partner pet-friendly hotels nearby.

## Common Areas

Pets are allowed in the hotel lobby (on leash), the garden and outdoor terrace, and designated outdoor dining areas. Pets are not allowed in the indoor restaurant, the pool area, the spa, the gym, the business center, or the kids' club.

Pets must be kept on a leash at all times in all common areas. Guests are fully responsible for their pet's behavior. If a pet causes a disturbance (excessive barking, aggressive behavior toward other guests), the guest will be asked to keep the pet in the room.

## Guest Responsibilities

Guests are responsible for cleaning up after their pet both inside the room and in common areas. Pet waste bags are provided at the garden entrance and at the concierge desk. Pets must not be left unattended in the room for more than 2 hours. If housekeeping cannot access a room due to an unattended pet, cleaning will be skipped and the guest will be notified.

Pets must not be bathed in the room's bathtub or shower. If a pet requires bathing, the concierge can recommend a local grooming service.

## Damage and Cleaning

A deep cleaning fee of €75 is applied after every pet stay to sanitize the room for future guests (particularly for guests with allergies). This fee is charged in addition to the nightly pet supplement.

Any damage caused by a pet (furniture, linens, flooring, fixtures) is assessed and charged to the guest's credit card. Common damages include scratched door frames, stained carpets or upholstery, and chewed furniture. Photos are taken before charging any damage, and the guest is informed with documentation.

If a pet causes damage to another guest's property or injures another guest, the pet owner is fully liable. The hotel's insurance does not cover pet-related incidents caused by guest pets.

## Noise Complaints About Pets

If a noise complaint is received about a barking or whining pet, the front desk calls the guest to address the issue. If the pet continues to disturb other guests after two warnings, the guest may be asked to make alternative arrangements for the animal. In extreme cases, the hotel reserves the right to ask the guest and pet to vacate the room, with a refund for unused nights.

## Local Information for Pet Owners

The concierge maintains a list of nearby veterinary clinics, pet pharmacies, pet stores, dog parks, and pet-friendly beaches. Walking routes suitable for dogs are available as a printed map at the concierge desk. The nearest 24-hour emergency veterinary clinic and its contact details are included in the pet welcome pack placed in the room at check-in.
