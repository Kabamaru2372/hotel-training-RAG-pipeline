# Noise Complaint Resolution

## Quiet Hours Policy

Quiet hours are in effect from 22:00 to 08:00 daily. During quiet hours, noise from guest rooms, the pool area, and outdoor terraces must be kept to a minimum. Music and entertainment in hotel venues end at 23:00 on weekdays and 00:00 on weekends (Friday and Saturday nights). After-hours room service and hallway movement should be conducted as quietly as possible.

## Receiving a Noise Complaint

When a guest calls to report a noise disturbance, respond with empathy and urgency. Record the following: complaining guest's name and room number, nature of the noise (music, talking, party, hallway, construction, HVAC, etc.), source of the noise if known (room number, location), time the noise started, and how severely it is affecting the guest.

Assure the guest that you will address it immediately. Provide a specific callback timeframe: "I will have this resolved or call you back within 15 minutes."

## Resolution Procedure

**Noise from another guest room**: Call the offending room first. Be polite but clear: "Good evening, this is the front desk. We've received a report of noise from your room. We'd kindly ask you to lower the volume as it's currently affecting neighboring guests. We appreciate your understanding." Do not reveal which guest complained.

If the noise continues after the first call, make a second call with a firmer tone: "We did contact you earlier about the noise level. We need to insist that the noise is reduced immediately, as it is disturbing other guests. Continued disturbance may result in further action."

If the noise continues after the second call, send Security to the room. Security will knock on the door and deliver a final verbal warning. If the noise still does not stop, the Duty Manager has the authority to issue a formal warning that further disturbance may result in the guest being asked to leave the hotel without a refund for the remaining nights.

**Noise from hotel operations**: If the noise is from the kitchen, laundry, HVAC, elevators, or other hotel systems, log a maintenance request immediately and apologize to the guest. Offer a room move if the noise cannot be stopped promptly. If construction or renovation work is scheduled during the guest's stay, proactive communication should have been sent before arrival — if it was not, offer compensation (upgrade, discount, or amenity).

**Noise from outside the hotel**: Traffic, street noise, or events not controlled by the hotel are acknowledged with empathy. Offer the guest earplugs (available at the front desk), a room move to a quieter side of the building, or additional pillows/blankets if they find white noise from the HVAC unit helpful.

## Escalation

First complaint: phone call to the offending room.
Second complaint (same source): phone call with stronger language plus Security notification.
Third complaint (same source): Security visit with formal warning.
Fourth complaint (same source): Duty Manager involvement, potential eviction.

Every step is logged in the PMS under both the complaining guest's profile and the offending guest's profile.

## Compensation for the Complaining Guest

If the noise significantly impacted the guest's sleep and the hotel was unable to resolve it promptly, appropriate compensation includes: a sincere apology from the Duty Manager (in person the following morning), complimentary breakfast, a room move with upgrade, a discount on the affected night (typically 25-50%), or a future stay voucher.

The level of compensation depends on the duration and severity of the disturbance. Front desk agents can offer up to a complimentary breakfast without manager approval. Discounts and vouchers require Duty Manager or Front Office Manager approval.

## Proactive Noise Management

For large groups, wedding parties, or events, the front desk should preemptively avoid assigning rooms adjacent to known gathering areas. Event contracts include a noise clause specifying acceptable levels and end times. The banqueting team is responsible for enforcing these clauses.

During periods of hotel renovation, affected rooms should be blocked from sale or sold at a reduced rate with full disclosure. Guests who booked before the renovation was announced should be upgraded or offered the option to cancel without penalty.

## Repeat Offenders

If a guest generates noise complaints on multiple nights, the Front Office Manager speaks with them directly to explain the hotel's expectations. A formal note is added to their guest profile for future stays. In extreme cases, the hotel reserves the right to decline future reservations from chronically disruptive guests.
