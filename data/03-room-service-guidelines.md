# Room Service — Menu and Operational Guidelines

## Operating Hours

Full menu room service is available from 06:30 to 23:00 daily. A limited night menu (sandwiches, salads, soups, and desserts) is available from 23:00 to 06:30. Breakfast room service begins at 06:30, with door-hanger orders collected by 02:00 for the requested delivery time.

## Ordering Process

Guests call extension 3 (Room Service) or use the in-room tablet to place orders. The order taker must confirm: guest name, room number, full order with any dietary modifications, estimated delivery time. Always repeat the full order back to the guest before confirming.

Standard delivery time is 30-40 minutes. Breakfast door-hanger orders are delivered within the 30-minute window specified by the guest (e.g., if they request 07:00-07:30, delivery must happen within that window). If any delay exceeds 15 minutes beyond the quoted time, the supervisor must call the guest to inform them.

## Delivery Standards

All room service deliveries use a fully set tray or trolley. Hot food is covered with cloches. Cold items are properly chilled. Condiments, cutlery, napkins, salt, and pepper must be included without the guest needing to ask. Every tray includes a small flower vase and the daily newspaper if the delivery is for breakfast.

Knock on the door and announce "Room Service." Wait 15 seconds. Knock again if no response. Never use a key card to enter the room. If there is no response after two attempts, call the room from the nearest house phone. If still no answer, return the order to the kitchen and log it.

Upon entry, ask the guest where they would like the tray set up. Offer to pour coffee or tea. Present the bill for signature. Wish the guest a pleasant meal and inform them to call extension 3 for tray collection when finished.

## Tray Collection

Trays left in the hallway are collected every 30 minutes by the room service team during operating hours. Between 23:00 and 06:30, housekeeping floor attendants collect trays during their rounds. Trays must never remain in the hallway for more than 1 hour.

## Dietary and Allergy Management

Every order must be screened for allergen declarations. If a guest mentions any allergy, the order taker flags it in the POS system, and the kitchen prepares the item in the designated allergen-safe station. Common allergens tracked: gluten, nuts, dairy, shellfish, eggs, soy.

For guests with severe allergies (noted in their profile), the chef prepares a personalized safe menu card delivered to the room at check-in. Vegan, vegetarian, halal, and kosher options are available on every menu and clearly marked with symbols.

## Pricing

A room service surcharge of €5 applies to all orders. This is clearly stated on the menu and must be mentioned by the order taker when confirming the order. Complimentary room service (VIP amenity, complaint resolution) must be authorized by the Front Office Manager or Duty Manager and recorded in the PMS.

## Minibar

The minibar is restocked daily by housekeeping between 10:00 and 14:00. Consumption is logged via the honor system (guest declaration) or automated minibar sensors where installed. Guests disputing minibar charges must be given the benefit of the doubt for first-time disputes — remove the charge and log it. Repeat disputes are escalated to the Front Office Manager.
