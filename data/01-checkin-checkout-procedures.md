# Check-In and Check-Out Procedures

## Standard Check-In (15:00)

Upon guest arrival, greet them warmly by name if a reservation exists. Verify their identity with a valid government-issued photo ID (passport for international guests) and the credit card used for booking. If a different card is presented, update the payment method in the PMS and obtain a new pre-authorization.

Run a pre-authorization on the guest's credit card for the full stay amount plus a €50 per night incidental hold. For cash-paying guests, collect the full stay amount upfront plus a €200 refundable security deposit. Issue a receipt for all cash transactions.

Confirm the room type, rate, and length of stay with the guest. Mention breakfast inclusion if applicable, Wi-Fi access details, and the location of key facilities (restaurant, pool, gym, spa). Provide two key cards and explain that key cards also control the in-room electricity slot.

For guests arriving before 15:00, check room availability. If the room is ready, offer early check-in at no charge. If not, offer luggage storage and direct them to the lobby lounge or suggest nearby attractions. Never promise early check-in — only confirm once housekeeping has cleared the room.

## Express Check-In

Guests who have completed online pre-registration can proceed to the express check-in desk. Verify ID, provide key cards, and confirm room number. This process should take no longer than 3 minutes.

## Standard Check-Out (11:00)

Review the guest's folio for any outstanding charges (minibar, room service, spa, parking). Present the folio to the guest for review and signature. Process the final payment and email or print the receipt based on guest preference.

Ask about their stay experience. If they mention any issue, apologize and log it in the PMS under guest feedback. Offer to arrange transportation to the airport or other destinations. Remind them to check the in-room safe before departing.

## Late Check-Out Requests

Guests may request late check-out. Approval depends on occupancy levels. If occupancy is below 80%, grant complimentary late check-out until 13:00. Between 80-90% occupancy, offer late check-out until 13:00 for a fee of €30. Above 90% occupancy, late check-out is generally unavailable but can be granted until 12:00 for loyalty program Gold and Platinum members at no charge. Late check-out beyond 14:00 is charged as a half-day rate. Beyond 18:00 is charged as a full additional night.

## Group Check-In

For groups of 10 or more, coordinate with the Group Reservations department at least 24 hours before arrival. Pre-assign rooms and prepare key card packets. Set up a dedicated check-in area in the lobby to avoid congesting the main front desk. The group coordinator or tour leader should receive a master list of all room assignments.

## No-Show Policy

Reservations not claimed by 00:00 on the arrival date are marked as no-shows. The first night is charged to the card on file. The remaining nights are released for sale. Prepaid non-refundable reservations are charged in full regardless of arrival.
