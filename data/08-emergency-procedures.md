# Emergency Procedures

## Fire Emergency

If you discover a fire: activate the nearest fire alarm pull station, call the fire department by dialing 112 (European emergency number), then call the hotel operator at extension 0 and state "Code Red" followed by the exact location. Do not attempt to fight the fire unless it is small and you have been trained to use a fire extinguisher.

When the fire alarm sounds, all staff must follow their assigned roles per the Emergency Response Plan posted in every department. Front Desk staff immediately pull the guest list with room numbers and mobility-impaired guest flags. Staff on each floor knock on every door and direct guests to the nearest stairwell — never use elevators during a fire. The Assembly Point is the main parking area to the east of the building.

The Duty Manager assumes the role of Incident Commander until the fire department arrives. The Duty Manager coordinates with the fire department, accounts for all guests using the guest list, and manages communication with emergency services.

Fire drills are conducted quarterly. All staff must participate. Drill performance is documented and reviewed by the Safety Committee.

## Medical Emergency

If a guest or staff member has a medical emergency, call 112 for an ambulance immediately, then call the hotel operator at extension 0 and state "Code Blue" followed by the location. Do not move the person unless they are in immediate danger. If the person is unconscious and not breathing, begin CPR if you are trained. AED defibrillators are located in the lobby, by the pool, in the gym, and on every other floor in the emergency equipment cabinet.

The Front Desk team directs the ambulance to the correct location and ensures clear access (hold elevators, open doors). A staff member must accompany the affected person to the hospital if they are a guest traveling alone, and bring the guest's passport and insurance information from the safe (if available).

Log all medical emergencies in the incident report system with full details. Do not post anything on social media. Refer all media inquiries to the General Manager.

## Earthquake

If an earthquake occurs, instruct everyone to Drop, Cover, and Hold — get under sturdy furniture, cover head and neck, and hold on until shaking stops. Do not run outside during shaking. Stay away from windows, mirrors, and heavy objects that could fall.

After shaking stops, the Duty Manager initiates a building inspection before allowing guests back into rooms. Check for structural damage, gas leaks (smell), water leaks, and electrical hazards. If any damage is found, evacuate the building to the Assembly Point and call emergency services.

## Power Outage

The hotel's emergency generator activates automatically within 15 seconds of a power failure. The generator powers: emergency lighting in corridors and stairwells, elevators (one at a time), the front desk and PMS system, fire safety systems, refrigeration for food storage, and security cameras.

The generator does not power guest room air conditioning or non-essential lighting. The Duty Manager makes a building-wide announcement via the PA system explaining the situation and estimated restoration time. Flashlights are distributed to each floor by security.

If the outage is expected to last more than 2 hours, offer guests the option of a complimentary meal in the restaurant (if operational) and consider offering room downgrades or refunds for severely impacted guests.

## Bomb Threat

If a bomb threat is received by phone: keep the caller talking as long as possible, note exactly what they say (use the Bomb Threat Checklist kept at every phone station), note the caller's voice characteristics (accent, gender, background noise), and signal a colleague to call 112 and the Duty Manager immediately.

The Duty Manager decides whether to evacuate based on the threat assessment with police guidance. If evacuation is ordered, use the same procedure as a fire evacuation but instruct staff and guests to take personal belongings with them (bags are not left behind in a bomb threat). Do not use radios or mobile phones near the suspected area.

## Suspicious Person or Package

Report any suspicious person or unattended package to Security immediately by calling extension 0, option 5. Do not confront suspicious individuals. Do not touch or move suspicious packages. Security will assess the situation and involve police if necessary. Maintain a safe distance of at least 30 meters from any suspicious package.

## Incident Reporting

All emergencies, incidents, and near-misses must be documented in the Incident Report system within 2 hours of occurrence. The report must include: date, time, location, persons involved, description of the incident, actions taken, names of responding staff and emergency services, and follow-up actions needed. The Safety Committee reviews all incident reports monthly.
