# Housekeeping Standards and Procedures

## Daily Room Cleaning

Standard rooms are cleaned between 09:00 and 15:00. The cleaning order priority is: departure rooms (first priority for resale), VIP rooms, guest-requested times, then all remaining occupied rooms.

Knock on the door three times, announcing "Housekeeping" each time with a 10-second pause between knocks. If no answer, enter using the master key card. If the guest is inside and declines service, note it in the system and place a fresh towel set outside the door in a bag. If the Do Not Disturb sign is displayed, skip the room and return later. If DND is displayed past 14:00, the Housekeeping Supervisor calls the room to offer service. If DND remains past 16:00 and the guest has not been seen, notify the Duty Manager for a welfare check.

## Cleaning Checklist — Standard Service

Bedroom: make the bed with fresh linens (top sheet folded 30 cm from the headboard), dust all surfaces including nightstands, desk, TV unit, and window sills, vacuum the carpet or mop hard floors, empty the trash bin and replace the liner, check and adjust the curtains and blackout blinds, ensure all lights and switches work, replenish stationery (notepad, pen, laundry slip).

Bathroom: replace all used towels (bath towel, hand towel, face cloth, bath mat), clean the toilet inside and out, clean the sink, mirror, and countertop, clean the bathtub or shower including glass panels, restock toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, soap, shower cap, cotton pads, cotton buds), ensure the hair dryer is in place and functional, empty and clean the bathroom trash bin, check that the exhaust fan is operational.

Minibar: check and restock consumed items (log consumption in the system), wipe down the exterior of the minibar, ensure the minibar is at the correct temperature.

General: check the air conditioning is functioning, ensure the TV remote has batteries and is positioned on the nightstand, check the wardrobe for previous guest items (check safe, drawers, under the bed), ensure the ironing board and iron are in the wardrobe, check that all hangers are present (minimum 10 per wardrobe), replenish the coffee and tea tray (2 coffee, 2 tea, sugar, milk pods, 2 cups, 2 spoons).

## Turndown Service

Turndown service is offered between 18:00 and 20:00 for suites and VIP rooms, and upon request for standard rooms. Turndown includes: close the blackout curtains, turn down the bed on the guest's preferred side (check which side is being used), place slippers at the bedside, place a chocolate or sweet on the pillow, replace used towels, empty bins, refresh water glasses, dim the room lighting and turn on the bedside lamp, set the room temperature to 22°C (unless the guest has set a preference).

## Deep Cleaning

Deep cleaning is performed on every room at least once per month, and always between guest stays that exceed 7 nights. Deep cleaning adds to the standard checklist: move and clean behind all furniture, clean the air conditioning filters, shampoo carpets or deep-clean hard floors, descale bathroom fixtures and showerheads, wash curtains or replace if stained, clean inside all drawers and the wardrobe, flip or rotate the mattress (per schedule), sanitize the TV remote, light switches, door handles, and all high-touch surfaces.

## Linen and Towel Standards

Bed linen is changed daily for departing rooms and every 2 days for staying guests (unless the guest requests daily changes or participates in the green program). The green program card is placed on the bed during turndown — if the guest places it on the pillow, linens are changed; if placed on the nightstand, they are not.

Towels are replaced whenever used towels are left on the floor or in the bathtub. Towels hung on the rack are not replaced (green program). Always replace the bath mat.

All linen must be inspected before making the bed — check for stains, tears, or discoloration. Any substandard linen is removed from circulation and sent to the laundry for treatment or disposal.

## Guest Laundry and Dry Cleaning

Laundry collected before 09:00 is returned by 18:00 the same day. After 09:00, next-day return applies. Express service (4-hour return) is available at a 50% surcharge. Dry cleaning is processed by our partner facility — standard return is 48 hours, express is 24 hours.

Laundry slips and bags are in the wardrobe. The guest fills in the slip and leaves the bag on the bed or calls Housekeeping for pickup. Items are counted and inspected upon collection — any discrepancy with the slip is confirmed with the guest before processing. Delicate items are handled separately and noted on the slip.

## Inspection Standards

The Housekeeping Supervisor inspects a minimum of 10 rooms per day (random selection across floors). Departure rooms are inspected before being released for sale. VIP rooms are always inspected before the guest's arrival. A room inspection takes 5-7 minutes and covers all checklist items. Rooms scoring below 90% on the inspection checklist must be re-cleaned immediately.
