# Guest Complaint Handling — Standard Operating Procedure

## The LEARN Framework

All staff must follow the LEARN method when handling guest complaints:

**Listen** — Let the guest explain the issue fully without interrupting. Maintain eye contact and attentive body language. Never cross your arms or look at your phone.

**Empathize** — Acknowledge their frustration. Use phrases like "I completely understand how frustrating that must be" or "I'm sorry you've had this experience." Never say "That's our policy" as a first response.

**Apologize** — Offer a sincere apology on behalf of the hotel, regardless of whether the hotel is at fault. "I'm truly sorry for the inconvenience" goes a long way.

**Resolve** — Take immediate action. If you can fix it on the spot, do it. If not, explain exactly what you will do and by when. Always give a specific timeframe, not "as soon as possible."

**Notify** — Log every complaint in the PMS under the guest profile. Notify the department manager involved. For serious complaints (safety, health, discrimination), escalate immediately to the Duty Manager.

## Empowerment Levels

**Front Desk Agents** can offer: room upgrades (within same category or one level up), complimentary late check-out, a fruit basket or amenity delivery, a meal voucher up to €30, waiving of one minibar charge. Total resolution value up to €100 without manager approval.

**Shift Supervisors** can additionally offer: cross-category room upgrades, complimentary spa treatment (30 min), meal vouchers up to €75, one complimentary night (for stays of 3+ nights). Total resolution value up to €300.

**Duty Manager / Front Office Manager** can offer: multiple complimentary nights, full refunds, future stay vouchers, any compensation deemed appropriate. No cap, but must be documented and reported to the General Manager for amounts over €500.

## Common Complaints and Recommended Responses

**Noise complaint** — Offer to call the offending room first. If the noise continues after 15 minutes, offer a room move. Log the incident for both rooms. If the noise is from hotel operations (renovation, events), proactively apologize and offer compensation before the guest complains.

**Room not clean** — Apologize immediately. Send housekeeping for express cleaning within 15 minutes. Offer the guest access to the lobby lounge or restaurant with a complimentary drink while they wait. If the issue is severe (stains, previous guest's belongings), upgrade the room immediately.

**Air conditioning not working** — Call engineering for immediate repair. If it cannot be fixed within 30 minutes, move the guest to another room. Provide a portable fan as an interim solution if available.

**Overcharge on folio** — Review the charge with the guest. If it's a legitimate error, correct it immediately and apologize. If the charge is valid, explain it clearly with supporting details (date, time, item). Never make the guest feel they are being accused of dishonesty.

**Overbooking situation** — This is a critical situation. The Duty Manager must handle this personally. Arrange alternative accommodation at an equivalent or superior hotel at the hotel's expense, provide transportation to the alternative hotel, offer a future complimentary night at our hotel, and follow up with a personal apology letter from the General Manager.

## Follow-Up

All complaints must receive a follow-up within 24 hours. The responsible department manager should personally check with the guest (in person or by phone) that the issue has been resolved. For written complaints (email, review sites), respond within 48 hours using the approved response templates. Never argue publicly on review platforms.

## Documentation

Every complaint must be logged with: guest name, room number, date and time, nature of complaint, action taken, compensation offered, staff member who handled it, and follow-up status. Monthly complaint reports are reviewed by the Executive Committee to identify recurring issues.
