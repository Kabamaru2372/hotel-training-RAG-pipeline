# Wi-Fi and In-Room Technology Guide

## Wi-Fi Access

Complimentary Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel. The network name is "HotelGuest" and guests connect using their surname and room number as login credentials. The login portal appears automatically when opening a browser. Each room supports up to 5 simultaneous device connections.

Standard Wi-Fi speed is 25 Mbps download and 10 Mbps upload, suitable for browsing, email, video calls, and standard streaming. Premium Wi-Fi (100 Mbps) is available for €10 per day or complimentary for loyalty program Gold and Platinum members. Premium Wi-Fi is recommended for guests who need to transfer large files, conduct multiple video conferences, or stream in 4K.

## Common Wi-Fi Issues and Solutions

**Cannot connect to the network**: Ensure the device's Wi-Fi is turned on and airplane mode is off. Forget the "HotelGuest" network and reconnect. If the login portal does not appear, open a browser and navigate to any http (not https) website, or try 1.1.1.1 in the browser address bar.

**Connected but no internet**: Clear the browser cache or try an incognito/private window. The login session may have expired — close all browsers and reconnect. If still failing, restart the device's Wi-Fi adapter (toggle Wi-Fi off and on).

**Slow connection**: Check if the guest is on Standard or Premium Wi-Fi. If standard, suggest upgrading to Premium. If already on Premium, check for bandwidth-heavy applications running in the background. During peak hours (19:00-22:00), speeds may be slightly reduced due to high demand.

**VPN connection issues**: Some corporate VPNs may not work on Standard Wi-Fi due to port restrictions. Premium Wi-Fi supports all VPN protocols. If a guest specifically needs VPN access, upgrade them to Premium.

If none of the above steps resolve the issue, log a ticket with IT support by calling extension 0 and selecting option 4. IT support responds within 30 minutes during business hours and within 1 hour after hours.

## Smart TV

Each room is equipped with a smart TV with the following features: live TV channels (local and international), Chromecast built-in for screen mirroring, streaming app access (guests can log into their own Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, etc.), hotel information channel (channel 1), and USB media playback.

Important: Guest streaming accounts are automatically logged out at check-out. However, remind guests during check-out to log out of any personal accounts on the TV manually as an extra precaution.

To cast from a phone or laptop: ensure the device is on the same Wi-Fi network as the TV, open the app and tap the cast icon, select the room TV from the list (identified by room number).

If the TV is not responding to the remote, check that the batteries are working (spare batteries are in the desk drawer). If the TV has no signal, unplug it from the wall, wait 10 seconds, and plug it back in. If the issue persists, call engineering on extension 0, option 3.

## In-Room Safe

The in-room safe is located inside the wardrobe. To set a code: open the safe, enter a 4-digit code, press the lock button, close the door. To open: enter the code and press the unlock button. If the guest forgets their code, the Duty Manager can open the safe using the master override device. This requires the guest to be present and show their ID.

Do not store passports in the safe if they are needed for check-out identity verification. Suggest guests use the safe for valuables, electronics, and cash. The hotel is not liable for items not stored in the safe, as stated in the registration card terms.

## Room Key Cards

Key cards also control the in-room electricity. Insert the card into the slot by the entrance door to activate lights and air conditioning. When the card is removed, lights will turn off after 30 seconds, but the air conditioning will continue running at the set temperature for 15 minutes before shutting off.

If a key card stops working, it can be re-encoded at the front desk in under 1 minute. The guest must present ID for re-encoding. Lost key cards carry no replacement fee, but the room lock is re-programmed as a security precaution.

## USB Charging and Power

All rooms have USB charging ports on both sides of the bed and on the desk. International power adapters are available at the front desk free of charge (subject to availability, €20 deposit refunded on return). The standard power supply is 230V / 50Hz with European Type C and Type F outlets.
