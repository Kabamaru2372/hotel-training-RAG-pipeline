## Transportation

**Airport transfers**: The hotel offers private airport transfers at €45 one-way (sedan, up to 3 guests) or €65 one-way (minivan, up to 7 guests). Transfers must be booked at least 12 hours in advance. The driver will be in the arrivals hall holding a sign with the guest's name. For departures, the car waits at the hotel entrance at the agreed time.

**Bicycle rental**: Available from the hotel directly at €12 per day or €8 per half-day. Helmets and locks are provided. Route maps for scenic cycling routes are available at the concierge desk.

## Restaurant Recommendations

The concierge maintains a curated list of recommended restaurants. All listed restaurants have been personally visited by the concierge team. Reservations can be made by the concierge on the guest's behalf.

When guests ask for restaurant recommendations, always ask: cuisine preference, budget range, occasion (casual dinner, celebration, business), number of guests, any dietary restrictions, preferred distance from the hotel. Provide 2-3 options with a brief description of each, including approximate cost per person, distance, and whether a reservation is needed.

If a recommended restaurant provides a poor experience, the guest should inform the concierge so the recommendation can be reviewed. The concierge list is updated quarterly based on guest feedback and personal visits.

## Attractions and Activities

The concierge can arrange tickets and transportation for local attractions, museums, tours, and experiences. Popular options include: guided city tours (walking or bus), museum passes, boat excursions, wine tasting tours, cooking classes, archaeological site visits, and water sports.

Booking commission-free experiences: the hotel partners with local tour operators who offer competitive rates. The concierge does not add any markup. For exclusive or private tours, arrange through the preferred tour operator list and confirm pricing directly with the guest before booking.

## Special Arrangements

**Flowers and gifts**: The concierge can arrange flower deliveries, birthday cakes, champagne, gift baskets, and personalized amenities for guest rooms. Orders should be placed at least 24 hours in advance. For birthday cakes, provide the name, any message to be written on the cake, and any dietary preferences.

**Event tickets**: The concierge can source tickets for concerts, theatre, sporting events, and local festivals. Availability and pricing are confirmed before any purchase. Payment is added to the guest's room bill.

**Medical services**: A list of English-speaking doctors, dentists, and pharmacies is maintained at the concierge desk. For non-emergency medical needs, the concierge can arrange an in-room doctor visit through our partner medical service (available 24 hours, typical response time 45-60 minutes, starting at €100 for a consultation).

**Business services**: Printing, scanning, photocopying, and fax services are available at the business center (lobby level, open 24 hours with key card access). The concierge can also arrange meeting room bookings, presentation equipment, and temporary office supplies.
