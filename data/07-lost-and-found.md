# Lost and Found Procedures

## When a Guest Reports a Lost Item

Take the report immediately — either in person, by phone, or via email. Record the following details: guest name, room number, check-in and check-out dates, description of the item (color, brand, size, distinguishing features), last known location of the item, and the guest's contact details (phone and email).

Check the Lost and Found storage room first. If the item is there, arrange return immediately. If not, contact Housekeeping to check the room (if the guest has departed and the room has not yet been cleaned or re-sold) and check with laundry if it might be in bed linens or towels. Also check the specific location the guest mentions (restaurant, pool, gym, lobby).

Respond to the guest within 4 hours with an update, even if the item has not been found. Never say "It's lost" — say "We are still searching and will continue to do so."

## When Staff Finds an Item

Any item found by any staff member must be brought to the Housekeeping office within 30 minutes of discovery. The item is logged in the Lost and Found register with: date and time found, exact location, description of the item, name of the staff member who found it, and a photo (for valuable items).

The Housekeeping Supervisor cross-references found items with the departed guest list and any open lost item reports. If a match is found, contact the guest immediately to arrange return.

## Storage and Retention

Items are stored in the Lost and Found room, which is locked and accessible only by Housekeeping Supervisors and the Front Office Manager. Valuable items (electronics, jewelry, cash, passports, wallets) are stored in the Lost and Found safe.

Retention periods: valuable items (electronics, jewelry, documents) are kept for 6 months, clothing and personal items are kept for 3 months, perishable items (food, flowers, opened cosmetics) are disposed of after 24 hours, medications are kept for 1 month and then disposed of through proper pharmaceutical disposal.

After the retention period, unclaimed non-valuable items are donated to charity. Unclaimed valuables are handed over to local authorities per local regulations.

## Returning Items to Guests

If the guest is still in the hotel, deliver the item to their room personally. If the guest has departed, contact them by phone first, then email. Offer to ship the item at the guest's expense (shipping cost plus a €10 handling fee). Obtain the guest's shipping address and preferred courier. The guest must confirm their identity before any item is shipped — verify with reservation details.

For passports and identity documents: contact the guest immediately. If unable to reach the guest within 48 hours, contact the relevant embassy or consulate for guidance.

For items of significant value (estimated over €500): require the guest to describe the item in detail before confirming possession. Ship with insurance and tracking. Obtain written authorization for shipping.

## Items Found in Public Areas

Items found in restaurants, the lobby, conference rooms, or other public areas are treated the same as room items. The specific outlet or department logs the item and sends it to the Housekeeping office. Security camera footage may be reviewed to identify the owner if the item is valuable and no one claims it within 24 hours.

## Staff Responsibilities

All staff must report found items promptly. Failure to report a found item or removal of found items from hotel premises is treated as theft and is grounds for immediate termination. This policy is communicated during staff orientation and reinforced in annual training.
