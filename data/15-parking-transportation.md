# Parking and Transportation Services

## Hotel Parking

The hotel offers both self-parking and valet parking.

**Self-parking**: Available in the underground garage, accessible from the hotel's side entrance on the east wing. The rate is €15 per day (24-hour period) for hotel guests. Day visitors pay €3 per hour with a maximum of €20 per day. The garage has 120 spaces total, including 6 accessible spaces near the elevator and 4 electric vehicle charging stations.

Guests receive a parking ticket upon entry. The ticket must be validated at the front desk before departure — unvalidated tickets are charged at the visitor rate. Lost tickets are charged a flat fee of €25.

**Valet parking**: Available at the main entrance from 07:00 to 23:00. The rate is €25 per day for hotel guests. The valet team retrieves vehicles within 10 minutes of the guest's request. Guests should call the concierge at extension 5 at least 10 minutes before they need their vehicle.

All valet-parked vehicles are insured against damage while in the hotel's possession. Guests should not leave valuables visible in the vehicle. The hotel is not responsible for items left inside vehicles.

**Overnight parking**: Both self-parking and valet rates include overnight parking. Check-out day parking is complimentary until 13:00 to accommodate late check-out requests. After 13:00, the daily rate applies.

## Electric Vehicle Charging

Four Level 2 charging stations (22 kW) are available in the underground garage on spaces P1-01 through P1-04. Charging is complimentary for hotel guests. The charging stations use Type 2 connectors (European standard). A charging cable is provided at each station, but guests with non-standard vehicles should bring their own adapter.

Charging sessions are limited to 8 hours to ensure availability. Once the vehicle is fully charged, guests are asked to move it to a regular parking space. If a charging space is occupied by a fully charged vehicle for more than 2 hours, the front desk will attempt to contact the guest.

## Airport Shuttle

A shared airport shuttle operates daily at fixed departure times: 06:00, 08:00, 10:00, 14:00, and 18:00. The shuttle departs from the main entrance. The fare is €12 per person one-way. Reservations must be made at the front desk or concierge by 20:00 the evening before.

The shuttle accommodates up to 8 passengers. If demand exceeds capacity, an additional vehicle is arranged or guests are offered a private transfer at the shuttle rate. The journey to the airport takes approximately 30 minutes depending on traffic.

Shuttle service from the airport to the hotel is available at arrival. Guests should pre-book through the reservation team and provide their flight number and arrival time. The driver will wait in the arrivals hall with a hotel sign. If the flight is delayed, the driver adjusts automatically (the hotel monitors flight arrivals).
