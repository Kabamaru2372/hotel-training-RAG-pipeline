## Pre-Arrival Preparation

All VIP arrivals are reviewed in the daily morning briefing at 09:00. The Front Office Manager distributes the VIP arrivals list to: Front Desk, Housekeeping, Room Service, Concierge, Security, and the General Manager.

For VIP 2 and above: the assigned room is inspected by the Housekeeping Supervisor no later than 2 hours before expected arrival. The amenity is placed in the room 1 hour before arrival. If the guest has stayed before, review their profile for preferences (pillow type, minibar preferences, newspaper, room temperature, floor preference, etc.) and set up the room accordingly.

For VIP 3 and VVIP: a pre-arrival call or email is made 48 hours before arrival to confirm preferences, arrival time, transportation needs, and any special requests. The Duty Manager or General Manager is present in the lobby at the expected arrival time.

## Arrival Handling

VIP 1: Standard check-in with priority (skip any queue). Mention the welcome amenity in their room.

VIP 2: Escorted check-in. The Duty Manager or Front Office Manager personally greets the guest, escorts them to the room, and completes check-in in-room (no front desk queue). Offer a brief tour of the hotel facilities if they haven't stayed before.

VIP 3 and VVIP: The General Manager or most senior manager on duty greets the guest at the entrance. Luggage is handled immediately by the bell team. Check-in is completed entirely in-room. The guest is never required to wait at the front desk for any reason.

## During the Stay

Housekeeping prioritizes VIP rooms for morning service. For VIP 2 and above, turndown service is mandatory (even if not requested). The Front Office Manager checks in with VIP 2+ guests within the first 24 hours to ensure satisfaction.

All VIP guest requests are flagged as high priority in the PMS and must be fulfilled within 50% of the standard response time. For example, if standard room service delivery is 40 minutes, VIP delivery target is 20 minutes.

Guest preferences discovered during the stay (e.g., they always order a specific coffee, they asked for extra towels) are logged in the guest profile for future stays.

## Departure

VIP 1: Standard check-out with priority. Thank them by name.

VIP 2 and above: The Front Office Manager or Duty Manager is available for a personal farewell. Express check-out is offered (folio emailed, no desk visit needed). A follow-up thank-you email is sent within 24 hours of departure, signed by the General Manager.

VVIP departures are coordinated with the guest's team and may include vehicle escort, private exit, and luggage pre-loading.

## Confidentiality

All VIP guest information is strictly confidential. Staff must never disclose the presence of any VIP guest to other guests, media, or any external party. Requests for information about VIP guests are directed to the General Manager's office. Breach of VIP confidentiality is a disciplinary offense.
