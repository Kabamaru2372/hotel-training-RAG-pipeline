# About This Training Assistant

## Who Built This System

This AI-powered training assistant was developed by Fotios (44, Greece) and Max (31, Germany), two data and AI specialists who designed the system to help hotel staff access operational knowledge quickly and accurately. The assistant is built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, meaning it draws answers directly from this hotel's official Standard Operating Procedures and training documents rather than from generic internet knowledge.

All content in this knowledge base has been written, reviewed, and approved by Fotios and Max in collaboration with hotel management. When the assistant provides an answer, it is grounded in the documents you are reading now.

## What This Assistant Is

The training assistant is a conversational tool that allows hotel staff to query the hotel's internal knowledge base using natural language. Instead of searching through binders or folders, staff can ask questions such as "What is the late check-out policy?" or "How do I handle a noise complaint from a VIP guest?" and receive accurate, policy-aligned responses in seconds.

The assistant does not improvise. It does not give personal opinions. Every answer it generates is anchored to the source documents in this knowledge base. If a question falls outside the scope of available documentation, the assistant will say so rather than guess.

## Scope of the Knowledge Base

The assistant covers the following operational areas:

- Check-in and check-out procedures
- Complaint handling and service recovery
- Room service and in-room dining guidelines
- Pool, gym, and wellness facility operations
- Wi-Fi and in-room technology support
- VIP guest protocols and amenity management
- Lost and found procedures
- Emergency and evacuation procedures
- Concierge and guest experience services
- Housekeeping standards and scheduling
- Loyalty program policies and FAQs
- Pet policy and guest accommodation
- Accessibility services and disability support
- Noise complaint resolution
- Parking and transportation coordination

If a department or scenario is not listed above, it may not yet be covered. In that case, refer to your line manager or department head for guidance.

## How to Use the Assistant

Staff should interact with the assistant through the designated hotel intranet portal or training interface. Questions should be specific and role-relevant. The more context provided, the more precise the answer.

Good examples of queries:
- "A guest is checking in before 15:00 and their room is not ready. What do I offer them?"
- "A Platinum loyalty member is requesting late check-out. What are the terms?"
- "A guest reports that their neighbor's music is too loud. What steps do I follow?"

Avoid asking the assistant for personal opinions, predictions about non-operational topics, or information about other guests. The assistant is a support tool for procedure and policy lookup — not a substitute for professional judgment or escalation to a supervisor.

## Limitations and Escalation

The assistant reflects the knowledge base as it was last updated. It is not connected to live hotel systems such as the PMS, room availability, or guest folios. Always use the PMS for real-time data.

If the assistant provides an answer that contradicts what you have been verbally instructed by management, defer to your manager and report the discrepancy to the training team so the documents can be reviewed and updated.

For urgent situations — medical emergencies, security incidents, serious guest complaints — do not consult the assistant. Follow your direct emergency procedures and contact your supervisor immediately.

## Updating the Knowledge Base

All requests to add, correct, or remove content from the knowledge base must be submitted to Fotios or Max through the hotel's training department. Unauthorized modifications to source documents are not permitted. The knowledge base is reviewed quarterly and updated as policies change.

Staff who identify outdated or incorrect information in the assistant's responses are encouraged to flag it through the intranet feedback form so that corrections can be prioritized.
