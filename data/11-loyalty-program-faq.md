# Loyalty Program — Frequently Asked Questions

## Program Overview

Our loyalty program is free to join and has three tiers: Silver, Gold, and Platinum. Members earn points on eligible room charges, dining, spa, and other hotel services. Points can be redeemed for free nights, upgrades, experiences, and partner rewards.

Enrollment is available at the front desk, on the hotel website, or through the mobile app. Guests must provide their name, email, and phone number to join. Membership is activated immediately and points begin accruing from the first eligible charge.

## Earning Points

Members earn 10 points per €1 spent on room charges (base rate, not including taxes and fees). Dining at hotel restaurants earns 5 points per €1. Spa services earn 5 points per €1. Minibar, room service, and other incidental charges earn 3 points per €1.

Bonus point promotions run periodically and are communicated via email and the app. Gold members earn a 25% point bonus on all spending. Platinum members earn a 50% point bonus on all spending.

Points are credited to the member's account within 48 hours of check-out. If points are missing, the member can submit a claim through the app or at the front desk with their folio as proof. Claims must be made within 90 days of the stay.

## Tier Qualification

**Silver**: Automatic upon enrollment. No stay requirement.

**Gold**: Achieved after 10 qualifying nights or 5 qualifying stays within a calendar year. Benefits: 25% point bonus, complimentary room upgrade (subject to availability at check-in), late check-out until 14:00, complimentary premium Wi-Fi, welcome amenity at each stay.

**Platinum**: Achieved after 25 qualifying nights or 15 qualifying stays within a calendar year.

Tier status is valid for the qualification year plus the following full calendar year. For example, if a member qualifies for Gold in March 2026, their Gold status is valid until December 31, 2027.

## Redeeming Points

**Free nights**: Redemption starts at 10,000 points per night for standard rooms. Suite redemptions start at 25,000 points. Availability for point nights is subject to capacity controls — not all dates may be available for redemption, particularly during peak periods and special events.

**Room upgrades**: Members can redeem 3,000 points for a one-category upgrade, confirmed at check-in. This is separate from the complimentary upgrades that Gold and Platinum members receive.

**Dining credits**: 2,000 points can be converted to a €20 dining voucher at any hotel restaurant.

**Partner rewards**: Points can be transferred to airline frequent flyer programs at a ratio of 2 hotel points = 1 airline mile. Transfer partners include major global airlines (list available on the website). Minimum transfer is 5,000 points.

Points expire after 24 months of account inactivity. Any earning or redemption activity resets the expiration clock. Members are notified by email 60 days before points are due to expire.

## Common Guest Questions

**"I forgot to give my loyalty number at check-in"**: No problem — we can add the membership number to the reservation retroactively, either during the stay or up to 90 days after check-out. Points will be credited within 48 hours of the update.

**"I booked through a third-party website, can I earn points?"**: Points are only earned on reservations booked directly through the hotel website, app, reservation center, or at the front desk. Third-party bookings (Booking.com, Expedia, etc.) are not eligible for points or tier credit. If a guest is unsure how they booked, check the reservation source in the PMS.

**"Can I use points and cash together for a night?"**: Yes, a Points + Cash option is available. Guests can redeem 5,000 points plus 50% of the standard room rate for a night. This is a popular option for members who don't have enough points for a full redemption.

**"I'm traveling with someone — can they earn points too?"**: Only the member whose name is on the reservation earns points. However, members can add up to 3 family members to a household account to pool points. Household members must share the same address.

**"Can I earn points on a group or conference booking?"**: Individual attendees can earn points if they provide their membership number and are the registered guest in the room. The meeting planner or group organizer earns points on the master account charges only if they have a direct agreement with the hotel's sales team.

## Front Desk Responsibilities

Always ask during check-in: "Are you a member of our loyalty program?" If not, briefly explain the benefits and offer to enroll them. It takes 2 minutes and significantly increases guest retention.

For existing members, greet them by tier: "Welcome back, Mr. Smith. As a Gold member, you've been upgraded to a Deluxe room today." Even acknowledging the membership verbally makes a significant impression on the guest's experience.

Ensure the loyalty number is attached to every reservation. If a walk-in guest is a member, add the number before closing the check-in. Missing loyalty numbers are the most common source of guest complaints related to the program.
