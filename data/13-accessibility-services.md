# Accessibility Services Guide

## Commitment

The hotel is committed to providing equal access and an exceptional experience for all guests, including those with physical, sensory, cognitive, or other disabilities. All staff receive annual accessibility awareness training. Guest requests related to accessibility are treated as priority and are never subject to additional charges.

## Accessible Rooms

The hotel has accessible rooms on every floor, located near elevators. These rooms feature: wider doorways (minimum 90 cm clearance), roll-in showers with grab bars, fold-down shower seats, and handheld showerheads, lowered closet rods and in-room safe, lowered peephole on the entry door, lever-style door handles throughout, emergency pull cords in the bathroom connected to the front desk, visual fire alarm indicators (flashing strobe lights) in addition to audible alarms, and adequate turning space for wheelchairs (150 cm turning radius).

Accessible rooms should be reserved when a guest indicates a need — do not assume or assign based on appearance. If an accessible room is given to a guest without a disability and a guest with a disability subsequently needs it, the non-disabled guest may need to be moved (with appropriate care and compensation).

## Mobility Assistance

Wheelchair-accessible routes exist from the main entrance through all public areas including the restaurant, pool deck (not pool access), business center, and meeting rooms. The pool has a wheelchair-accessible lift for water entry (assistance available from pool staff).

The hotel has 2 wheelchairs available for guest use at no charge (subject to availability, first-come basis). Guests requiring a wheelchair for their entire stay should arrange their own or request the concierge to arrange rental through a medical equipment provider.

All elevators have braille buttons, audible floor announcements, and a lowered control panel. In the event of an elevator failure during an emergency, trained staff assist mobility-impaired guests using evacuation chairs stored on each floor.

## Hearing Impairment

Available upon request: visual notification devices for the doorbell and telephone (flashing light alerts), TTY/TDD telephone equipment, closed-captioning activated on the in-room TV, written communication for all essential information (check-in instructions, fire safety, hotel services). The front desk has a hearing loop installed. Staff are trained to face the guest when speaking, speak clearly, and offer written communication as needed.

For fire alarms and emergencies, rooms equipped with visual alert systems are prioritized for guests with hearing impairments. The fire safety team is briefed on the location of hearing-impaired guests to ensure personal notification during evacuations.

## Visual Impairment

Available upon request: large-print menus for the restaurant and room service, braille hotel directory and room service menu, audio description of the hotel layout and room features provided at check-in, staff escort to the room and orientation tour (location of bed, bathroom, light switches, phone, thermostat, safe), consistent room layout to aid familiarity.

Guide dogs are welcome in all areas of the hotel, including the restaurant, as per service animal policy. Water bowls for guide dogs can be provided in the room and at the restaurant.

## Cognitive and Neurological Accessibility

Staff are trained to communicate simply and patiently. Written instructions and visual guides are available for in-room technology (TV, thermostat, safe, coffee machine). If a guest appears confused or disoriented, staff should offer calm, supportive assistance without being condescending. The Duty Manager should be notified if a guest appears to need additional support.

For guests with autism or sensory sensitivities, the hotel can offer: a quiet room away from elevators and high-traffic areas, advance information about the room layout and hotel environment (photos available upon request), low-stimulation check-in (private area, minimal wait), and reduced housekeeping visits upon request.

## Dining Accessibility

The restaurant has accessible seating areas that accommodate wheelchairs without needing to move furniture. High chairs with additional support straps are available for children with physical disabilities. Menus are available in large print and braille. Staff can read the menu aloud upon request. Dietary modifications for medical conditions (celiac disease, diabetes, phenylketonuria, etc.) are handled by the chef with advance notice.

## Booking and Communication

When a guest indicates any accessibility need during booking, the reservation is flagged in the PMS. A pre-arrival email or call is made to confirm specific requirements and ensure everything is prepared. The front desk, housekeeping, and relevant departments are briefed before the guest's arrival.

Accessibility requests made after booking or at check-in are accommodated as quickly as possible. If a specific accommodation cannot be met, staff must explain what alternatives are available and seek the guest's agreement. Never say "We can't do that" — always say "Let me find out what we can do."

## Feedback

Guest feedback on accessibility is actively encouraged and reviewed by the Accessibility Committee quarterly. Feedback forms (physical and digital) include specific questions about accessibility experience. Any identified barrier is documented and reviewed for remediation.
